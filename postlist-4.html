<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>Digital history is public facing. As such, a certain amount of what you'll be assessed on will be your public engagement with the materials.  But there's public, and then there's public:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wondermark.com/c/2014-09-19-1062sea.png" /></p>
<p><a href="http://wondermark.com/1k62/">Wondermark</a></p>
<p>There's also <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-08-10-do-i-own-my-domain-if-you-grade-it">the question of the authenticity of the exercise if I force you to do it in public</a>. That's a really important issue that we should think about.  </p>
<p>For all public-facing work, you may use a psuedonymn for everything that leaves a trace on the internet, if you so desire. Just let me know who you are! There is value in using your real name, but what is safe for me as a middle-aged white man to do online is not safe for everyone. You have the right to not have any public facing work at all; we will arrive at an equitable solution that meets the learning objectives of this course <strong>provided you tell me as soon as possible</strong>. If you don't let me know, I can't make arrangements.</p>

</ul>
<p>You will keep a research labbook in a repository on <strong>Github</strong> that details the work you do for each module. What can go into this? Everything and anything. Files you create. Notes you make to yourself on how to use a particular tool. Random thoughts as they occur. In essence, there are many ways to craft digital history; you need to leave yourself breadcrumbs so that you can return to a project after a hiatus and know what it was you were doing/thinking at the time. Caleb McDaniel calls this <a href="http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html">open notebook history</a> and you should read that post of his before going any further. FYI, here's my own repository for my research: <a href="http://github.com/shawngraham">http://github.com/shawngraham</a>.</p>
<p>You should also keep a narrative of your research. A blogging platform is a good way of doing that. FYI, here's mine: <a href="http://electricarchaeology.ca">Electric Archaeology</a></p>
<p>Once you have these two pieces set up (which you will do during the first week of the course) I will set up a page on this site and in our Slack space so that you can find each other.</p>
<p>Those two pieces - your labbook, and the narrative you keep - are the pieces upon which assessment is based. These will be set up by you and the narrative will live on the domain you create.</p>
<p>I would suggest updating your repository, and your narrative, <strong>at least once per week at a minimum</strong>. Here is a <a href="https://github.com/craftingdigitalhistory/helpful-things/blob/master/weekly-template.md">template checklist</a> which you may use so that you can keep track of where you're at.</p>
<p>Below, I detail how I will divy up the grades:</p>
<h2 id="community-building">Community building</h2>
<p>Digital history is not done in isolation. In contrast to other courses you may have done, <strong>I expect you to collaborate</strong>, to help each other out, to problem solve. <strong>However that doesn't absolve you of doing the work</strong>. That means, if you had help working through an exercise (for instance), you would make a public note of the help you needed, who helped you out, and how.  How will you do this? You could make a post in your narrative about how you helped someone out - or how they helped you out. You could read someone else's narrative about their work and perhaps that sparks a thought or idea in you. You could then write about that, and link back to your peer's original work. </p>
<p>Community building can also happen in our private Slack space. Maybe you organize folks into a reading group. Maybe you set up a group video-chat session. All these things create a cohesive group, and I will be watching for evidence of this. </p>
<p><strong>Unacknowledged help or unacknowledged collaborative work will be grounds for losing points in this category.</strong></p>
<h2 id="module-exercises">Module Exercises</h2>
<p>In the <a href="http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca">workbook</a>, there are five modules. The modules contain readings, and exercises aimed at various levels of comfort with things digital. That is to say, if you've never done anything with your computer other than updating Facebook, there are exercises designed to introduce you to computing; if you are doing a computer science minor on the side, there are exercises designed to challenge you too. The idea is that you work through the exercises <strong>until you get stumped</strong>. You detail where you were at and how you got stumped, in your narrative in your notebook. You ask each other for help, encourage each other, and discuss the exercises, in our Slack space.</p>
<p>I am not interested so much in your final product as <strong>I am interested in your progress</strong>. The grading of the module work is not on whether you end up with a 'right' or 'wrong' piece, but rather, how you have grown and challenged yourself. Should you be someone for whom the exercises hold no challenge, then I challenge you to <strong>write the next exercise yourself</strong>. I'm always learning: I would be disappointed if I learned nothing from all of you. In fact, I doubt that will happen. The challenge of these modules: <strong>you must push yourself beyond your comfort level</strong>. That is what I am looking to assess. If I see that you are only trying the minimum level when it is apparent that you could be pushing further, this will be grounds for how points are lost here. </p>
<p>(by the way, the source files for the workbook are housed in their own github repository; you are welcome to make a copy of that workbook by 'forking' the repository. More information about how github works is found in the workbook introduction).</p>
<p>What you submit: select your six best exercises (and so, at least one from each module). Put them into the digital exhibit platform <a href="http://omeka.org">Omeka</a> (which you will install on your own domain, or on <a href="http://omeka.net">Omeka.net</a>). Create an exhibit that uses these exercises to show how you've grown as a historian. This will take some time; give yourself at least a day to do this (here's <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/creating-an-omeka-exhibit">some help on setting up an exhibit</a>; more will be provided). </p>
<p>Send the link to your exhibit to me via a direct message in our Slack space.</p>
<h2 id="final-project-paradata">Final Project &amp; Paradata</h2>
<p>Your final project will be in two parts. The first part will be a piece where you have crafted an original piece of digital history - see <a href="finalproject.html">these detailed instructions</a>.  The second part is a reflective piece on the first, called 'paradata'. 'Paradata' is a description of the 'how' and 'why' of what you're doing (see also the 'when things go wrong' section on the detailed instructions). A formal discussion of what paradata do from the <a href="http://www.londoncharter.org/introduction.html">London Charter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Documentation of the evaluative, analytical, deductive, interpretative and creative decisions made in the course of computer-based visualisation should be disseminated in such a way that the relationship between research sources, implicit knowledge, explicit reasoning, and visualisation-based outcomes can be understood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your paradata document should have the following sections (<a href="http://www.londoncharter.org/principles.html">as discussed in the London Charter</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Implementation; Aims and Methods; Research Sources; Documentation; Sustainability; and Access</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My strategy here is two-fold. I recognize that sometimes, a project fails to come together. I believe in 'productive failure', where we learn from what works and what doesn't work. <strong>I want to explicitly signal to you that it is safe to try something here that might not get to where you want it to go - and that's ok</strong>. As an example, let me share with you '<a href="http://electricarchaeology.ca/2012/05/18/how-i-lost-the-crowd-a-tale-of-sorrow-and-hope/">How I lost the crowd</a>', a piece where a public digital history work of my own fell to pieces - and how I salvaged worth from it. (As an example of 'paradata' it's not strictly speaking as formal as I want from you.)</p>
<h2 id="weekly-face-to-face-chatsoffice-hours">Weekly face to face chats/'office hours'</h2>
<p>I will set up a weekly face-to-face video chat with anyone who wishes to participate. The exact URL will be shared in our private Slack channel; we will use an open source tool called 'Big Blue Button' for this. You are not graded on this (except insofar as it can be a way of signalling 'community building'). These chats will take place in the evenings, typically on Tuesdays or Thursdays, at 8.30 pm Eastern standard time. People who want to participate will be expected to give some indication on the day of the precise things they want to talk about - we <strong>will</strong> have an agenda. This will be posted before hand on this website. Other times for one-on-one can be arranged by appointment. If you are on Carleton campus, we can meet in person.</p>
