<p>Increasingly, numerous historical documents making massive amounts of data are being put online. But, once that material is online, we face a question of ‘so what?’ This course will give you the digital research and data management skills and reflexive theoretical grounding to answer the ‘so what’. As digital historian Adam Crymble writes, ‘We’ve spent millions digitizing the world’s historical resources. Let’s work together to figure out what they can teach us’.</p>
<p>This course is about crafting digital history, about data mining documents, about reading distantly thousands of documents at once, about graphing/mapping/visualizing what we find, and working out how to best communicate those findings. It is about writing history in digital media, which are primarily visual media. Thus, we will learn how to scrape data, how to find meaningful patterns within it, and how to visualize (via websites or infographics) those results. Readings will be from relevant literature in the field (mostly open access).</p>
<p>Things will go wrong. Stuff will break. You will be frustrated. This will not be easy, but it will be rewarding if you stick it out.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify and define the limitations of useful sources of historical data online</li>
<li>Compare and employ appropriate tools to clean and manipulate this data with a critical eye to how the tools themselves are theory-laden</li>
<li>Analyze data using various tools with an awareness of the tendency of tools to push towards various historiographic or epistemic perspectives (ie, the ‘procedural rhetorics’ of various tools)</li>
<li>Visualize meaningful patterns in the data to write ‘good history’ across multiple platforms, with critical evaluation of the limitations</li>
<li>Model best practices in open access data management as mandated by SSHRC and other research agencies</li>
<li>Develop an online scholarly voice to contribute data and reflection to the wider digital history community</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h2>
<p>The modules in the course are built around the progressive steps of working with big data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Principles of open access research and your digital identity (learning outcomes 5,6)</li>
<li>Finding Data (learning outcomes 1)</li>
<li>‘Wrangling’ Data, or getting it into useable shape (learning outcome 2)</li>
<li>First Questions, or where are the holes and assumptions in your data?</li>
<li>Analyzing data, or matching the appropriate tool to the question (learning outcomes 1,2,3)</li>
<li>Visualizing (graphing, writing, plotting, mapping) data patterns, or communicating the compelling story (learning outcome 4)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="textbook">Textbook</h2>
<p>The course workbook is free, and may be found at workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca  </p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-need-to-succeed">What do you need to succeed?</h2>
<p>This course is not easy. It has no mutliple choice tests, no assignments that you can crib via a google search. Rather, it expects you to take responsibility for your own learning, and for you to make a convincing argument showing how you’ve changed as a historian. It requires you to be</p>
<ul>
<li>self-directed;</li>
<li>motivated;</li>
<li>self-disciplined;</li>
<li>able to admit to yourself and to others when things aren’t going according to plan;</li>
<li>able to collaborate with others in a transparent manner, giving credit where credit is due;</li>
<li>committed to working through in public the problems and potentials of digital history;</li>
</ul>
<p>If this sounds like you, or someone you are willing to become, then you will be ok. Now that you’ve got this far, please make sure to complete the ‘<a href="questionnaire.html">pre class questionnaire</a>’.</p>

<p>In our Slack channel, you can always send me a direct message. That is probably the most efficient (and preferred) way for you to contact me. Within Slack, we can set up instant video chats - simply type /appear roomname where roomname can be whatever you want (it acts like a location for our conversation), when we are both online. Othertimes, I might put together large-scale real-time video conferencing; for that I will use tools in cuLearn and I will advise you of the same. </p>

<p>It is easy to misjudge communication in a fully online course. Our interactions are mediated by the screen; there can be a real sense of disconnect, that the username on the other end is not really a person. For this class to work, we have to maintain high standards of mutual respect, appropriate behaviour, and generous interaction. Just because we're interacting through a screen doesn't mean we're not real, right?</p>
<p>The best piece of advice I ever heard about working in an academic environment (and I wish I had the source), was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'We are all smart here. Distinguish yourself by being kind'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By 'kindness', I take to mean, assuming the best of the other person you are dealing with. It might sound corny and naive, but if you put the needs of your peers with whom you are working ahead of your own, you both will win (there's actually game-theoretic research that shows this too; look up the iterated prisoner's dilemma).</p>
<p>But, it might be helpful to spell out how this all works (riffing on &amp; reproducing some of GeekFeminism's <a href="http://geekfeminism.org/about/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>). So, please avoid and refrain from making:</p>
<ul>
<li>offensive comments related to race, gender, origin, sexual orientation, disability,religion, pysical appearance</li>
<li>gratuitous sexual imagery (whether written or images)</li>
<li>threats</li>
<li>encouragement to perform violence or self-harm</li>
<li>intimidation, stalking, following</li>
<li>sustained disruption of conversations </li>
<li>unwelcome sexual attention, or patterns of inappropriate/unwanted social contact</li>
<li>publication of private communication</li>
<li>continued communication one-on-one after receiving a request to stop.</li>
</ul>
<p>... basically, be kind, be generous, support each other. </p>
