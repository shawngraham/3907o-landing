<h2 id="setting-up-video-annotation">Setting up Video &amp; Annotation</h2>
<p>You will end up installing a number of pieces of free software as you move through this course. But to begin, we need to put some things on your machine that will enable me to understand what you are seeing and experiencing as you move through the course, should things not quite click for you. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://screencast-o-matic.com/">Screen-cast-o-matic</a> allows you to make quick videos. When something doesn't work, you can use this free software to make a video where you can talk me through what you are doing and where things are going wrong</li>
<li><a href="https://hypothes.is/">Hypothes.is</a> This is a plugin for <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html">the Chrome browser</a>. Install both Chrome and Hypothes.is. With this plugin, you can highlight text in our <a href="http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca">workbook</a> and create an annotation that everyone can see. These annotations can have threaded conversations, so feel free to annotate the workbook as you see fit - highlight things that are confusing, or that work well, or that strike you as interesting because of x, y, z. Annotate things that you think might be useful in your other classes, too!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-a-community">Setting up a community</h2>
<p>Then there is the problem of how do we make this feel like a class, with actual living humans in it, when it's all online? </p>
<ul>
<li>A free account for Slack https://slack.com/ which handles our private communications. You will receive in your Cumail account a link to a private website into which you will enter your cumail email account. This will give you access to your space.</li>
<li>An account on Github http://github.com; you will set this up on your own.</li>
<li>Twitter is optional, but most digital humanities / digital history folks are on there, and that’s where a lot of the field is discussed (look up Dan Cohen, the executive director of the Digital Public Library of America, who maintains an excellent list; a great place to start!) Our course hashtag will be <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=hist3907o&amp;src=typd">#hist3907o</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-a-digital-laboratory">Setting up a digital laboratory</h2>
<p>Finally, you will need a kind of 'digital laboratory' or 'workshop' for yourself. I understand this to mean a kind of ecosystem of both offline and online spaces that interconnect, and enable us to work through the potentials of digital history. </p>
<ul>
<li>You will receive a code for a free one-year domain of your own hosted by <a href="http://reclaimhosting.com">Reclaim Hosting</a>. This code will be tied to your official Carleton email account. This webspace is yours to experiment with, but it will also host your own ‘digital history laboratory’. You will set this up on your own, as part of the initial exercises in this class. At the end of the calendar year, you can choose to renew (which costs $US 25) or you can cancel the account.</li>
<li>Please also make a note of the course repositories at <a href="https://github.com/craftingdigitalhistory/helpful-things/blob/master/weekly-template.md">https://github.com/craftingdigitalhistory/</a> and at <a href="https://github.com/shawngraham/hist3907o">https://github.com/shawngraham/hist3907o</a>. I encourage you to 'fork' (or take a copy) of these for your future reference.</li>
