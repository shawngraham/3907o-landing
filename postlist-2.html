<p>First, you need to put two pieces of software on your machine which will enable you to communicate to me when things are going wrong.</p>
<h3 id="video-annotations">Video &amp; Annotations</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://screencast-o-matic.com/">Screen-cast-o-matic</a> allows you to make quick videos. When something doesn't work, you can use this free software to make a video where you can talk me through what you are doing and where things are going wrong</li>
<li><a href="https://hypothes.is/">Hypothes.is</a> This is a plugin for <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html">the Chrome browser</a>. Install both Chrome and Hypothes.is. With this plugin, you can highlight text in our <a href="http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca">workbook</a> and create an annotation that everyone can see. These annotations can have threaded conversations, so feel free to annotate the workbook as you see fit - highlight things that are confusing, or that work well, or that strike you as interesting because of x, y, z. Annotate things that you think might be useful in your other classes, too!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="private-conversations-and-collaboration">Private conversations and collaboration</h3>
<ul>
<li>A free account for Slack https://hist3907o.slack.com/ which handles our private communications. You will receive an invitation email from Dr. Graham</li>
<li>An account on Github http://github.com; you will set this up on your own.</li>
<li>A digital history laboratory space. You will receive a code for a free one-year domain of your own hosted by <a href="http://reclaimhosting.com">Reclaim Hosting</a>. This code will be tied to your official Carleton email account. This webspace is yours to experiment with, but it will also host your own ‘digital history laboratory’. You will set this up on your own, as part of the initial exercises in this class. At the end of the calendar year, you can choose to renew (which costs $US 25) or you can cancel the account.</li>
<li>
<p>Please also make a note of the course repositories at <a href="https://github.com/craftingdigitalhistory/helpful-things/blob/master/weekly-template.md">https://github.com/craftingdigitalhistory/</a> and at <a href="https://github.com/shawngraham/hist3907o">https://github.com/shawngraham/hist3907o</a></p>

<p>Twitter is optional, but most digital humanities / digital history folks are on there, and that’s where a lot of the field is discussed (look up Dan Cohen, the executive director of the Digital Public Library of America, who maintains an excellent list; a great place to start!) Our course hashtag will be <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=hist3907o&amp;src=typd">#hist3907o</a></p>

<p>Increasingly, numerous historical documents making massive amounts of data are being put online. But, once that material is online, we face a question of ‘so what?’ This course will give you the digital research and data management skills and reflexive theoretical grounding to answer the ‘so what’. As digital historian Adam Crymble writes, ‘We’ve spent millions digitizing the world’s historical resources. Let’s work together to figure out what they can teach us’.</p>
<p>This course is about crafting digital history, about data mining documents, about reading distantly thousands of documents at once, about graphing/mapping/visualizing what we find, and working out how to best communicate those findings. It is about writing history in digital media, which are primarily visual media. Thus, we will learn how to scrape data, how to find meaningful patterns within it, and how to visualize (via websites or infographics) those results. Readings will be from relevant literature in the field (mostly open access).</p>
<p>Things will go wrong. Stuff will break. You will be frustrated. This will not be easy, but it will be rewarding if you stick it out.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify and define the limitations of useful sources of historical data online</li>
<li>Compare and employ appropriate tools to clean and manipulate this data with a critical eye to how the tools themselves are theory-laden</li>
<li>Analyze data using various tools with an awareness of the tendency of tools to push towards various historiographic or epistemic perspectives (ie, the ‘procedural rhetorics’ of various tools)</li>
<li>Visualize meaningful patterns in the data to write ‘good history’ across multiple platforms, with critical evaluation of the limitations</li>
<li>Model best practices in open access data management as mandated by SSHRC and other research agencies</li>
<li>Develop an online scholarly voice to contribute data and reflection to the wider digital history community</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h2>
<p>The modules in the course are built around the progressive steps of working with big data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Principles of open access research and your digital identity (learning outcomes 5,6)</li>
<li>Finding Data (learning outcomes 1)</li>
<li>‘Wrangling’ Data, or getting it into useable shape (learning outcome 2)</li>
<li>First Questions, or where are the holes and assumptions in your data?</li>
<li>Analyzing data, or matching the appropriate tool to the question (learning outcomes 1,2,3)</li>
<li>Visualizing (graphing, writing, plotting, mapping) data patterns, or communicating the compelling story (learning outcome 4)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="textbook">Textbook</h2>
<p>The course workbook is free, and may be found at workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca  </p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-need-to-succeed">What do you need to succeed?</h2>
<p>This course is not easy. It has no mutliple choice tests, no assignments that you can crib via a google search. Rather, it expects you to take responsibility for your own learning, and for you to make a convincing argument showing how you’ve changed as a historian. It requires you to be</p>
<ul>
<li>self-directed;</li>
<li>motivated;</li>
<li>self-disciplined;</li>
<li>able to admit to yourself and to others when things aren’t going according to plan;</li>
<li>able to collaborate with others in a transparent manner, giving credit where credit is due;</li>
<li>committed to working through in public the problems and potentials of digital history;</li>
</ul>
<p>If this sounds like you, or someone you are willing to become, then you will be ok. Now that you’ve got this far, please make sure to complete the ‘<a href="questionnaire.html">pre class questionnaire</a>’.</p>

<p>In our Slack channel, you can always send me a direct message. That is probably the most efficient (and preferred) way for you to contact me. Within Slack, we can set up instant video chats - simply type /appear roomname where roomname can be whatever you want (it acts like a location for our conversation), when we are both online. Othertimes, I might put together large-scale real-time video conferencing; for that I will use tools in cuLearn and I will advise you of the same. </p>
