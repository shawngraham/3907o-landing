<p>Increasingly, numerous historical documents making massive amounts of data are being put online. But, once that material is online, we face a question of ‘so what?’ This course will give you the digital research and data management skills and reflexive theoretical grounding to answer the ‘so what’. As digital historian Adam Crymble writes, ‘We’ve spent millions digitizing the world’s historical resources. Let’s work together to figure out what they can teach us’.</p>
<p>This course is about crafting digital history, about data mining documents, about reading distantly thousands of documents at once, about graphing/mapping/visualizing what we find, and working out how to best communicate those findings. It is about writing history in digital media, which are primarily visual media. Thus, we will learn how to scrape data, how to find meaningful patterns within it, and how to visualize (via websites or infographics) those results. Readings will be from relevant literature in the field (mostly open access).</p>
<p>Things will go wrong. Stuff will break. You will be frustrated. This will not be easy, but it will be rewarding if you stick it out.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify and define the limitations of useful sources of historical data online</li>
<li>Compare and employ appropriate tools to clean and manipulate this data with a critical eye to how the tools themselves are theory-laden</li>
<li>Analyze data using various tools with an awareness of the tendency of tools to push towards various historiographic or epistemic perspectives (ie, the ‘procedural rhetorics’ of various tools)</li>
<li>Visualize meaningful patterns in the data to write ‘good history’ across multiple platforms, with critical evaluation of the limitations</li>
<li>Model best practices in open access data management as mandated by SSHRC and other research agencies</li>
<li>Develop an online scholarly voice to contribute data and reflection to the wider digital history community</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h2>
<p>The modules in the course are built around the progressive steps of working with big data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Principles of open access research and your digital identity (learning outcomes 5,6)</li>
<li>Finding Data (learning outcomes 1)</li>
<li>‘Wrangling’ Data, or getting it into useable shape (learning outcome 2)</li>
<li>First Questions, or where are the holes and assumptions in your data?</li>
<li>Analyzing data, or matching the appropriate tool to the question (learning outcomes 1,2,3)</li>
<li>Visualizing (graphing, writing, plotting, mapping) data patterns, or communicating the compelling story (learning outcome 4)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="textbook">Textbook</h2>
<p>The course workbook is free, and may be found at workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca  </p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-need-to-succeed">What do you need to succeed?</h2>
<p>This course is not easy. It has no mutliple choice tests, no assignments that you can crib via a google search. Rather, it expects you to take responsibility for your own learning, and for you to make a convincing argument showing how you’ve changed as a historian. It requires you to be</p>
<ul>
<li>self-directed;</li>
<li>motivated;</li>
<li>self-disciplined;</li>
<li>able to admit to yourself and to others when things aren’t going according to plan;</li>
<li>able to collaborate with others in a transparent manner, giving credit where credit is due;</li>
<li>committed to working through in public the problems and potentials of digital history;</li>
</ul>
<p>If this sounds like you, or someone you are willing to become, then you will be ok. Now that you’ve got this far, please make sure to complete the ‘<a href="questionnaire.html">pre class questionnaire</a>’.</p>

<p>In our Slack channel, you can always send me a direct message. That is probably the most efficient (and preferred) way for you to contact me. Within Slack, we can set up instant video chats - simply type /appear roomname where roomname can be whatever you want (it acts like a location for our conversation), when we are both online. Othertimes, I might put together large-scale real-time video conferencing; for that I will use tools in cuLearn and I will advise you of the same. </p>

<p>This site is a static site generated using the python package 'PyKwiki'. Individual files are written in markdown format. Then, at the command line, I run <code>$ python pywkiki cache -f</code> which reads all of my markdown files and turns them into static html. These html files are then synced to a github repository on the gh-pages branch. That branch is configured using a <code>CNAME</code> file to point to the domain I registered for this course, <code>craftingdigitalhistory.ca</code>.  That domain is similarly configured with a <code>CNAME</code> entry via the cpanel to point back to <code>shawngraham.github.io</code>. This way, instead of futzing with ftp, I use version control to keep everything in sync. This also has the happy side effect that you can fork a copy of this site for your own reference.</p>
<p>I've used wordpress blogs in the past for course websites, and these work well enough. But I've become disenchanted with the Wordpress interface, and I rather like the idea of writing once, deploying everywhere. When I write in markdown, the plain text files stay with me and I can use <code>pandoc</code> to convert them to whatever else I need. The other thing is, these files will always remain machine readable, whatever Microscoft or Apple do. </p>
<p>You, too, will learn how to do this.</p>
