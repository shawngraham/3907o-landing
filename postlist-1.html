<h1 id="due-dates">Due Dates</h1>
<p>Because this is an online course, and it is entirely feasible that one might complete all of the work in short order, the due dates for work are necessarily extended.</p>
<h2 id="final-project-and-associated-paradata">Final Project and associated paradata</h2>
<p>Submit the link to your final project by the final day of term, via a direct message to me in Slack.
    + I would also like a one-page summary of work to date, topic, any agreed upon collaboration (which would include a paragraph on roles, responsibilities, and plan for resolving disputes), scale and scope to be sent to me via direct message in Slack by the end of the first week of March.</p>
<h2 id="exhibit-of-your-learning">Exhibit of your learning</h2>
<p>That is, your selected module exercises. Submit the link to your exhibit detailing your growth in this classs, at any point up to the final day of term. While I have specified a minimum for what needs to go in here, you are free to include other items (such as blog posts, videos) etc that help tell the story. </p>
<p>The <a href="assessment.html">Assessment</a> and <a href="finalproject.html">Final Project</a> pages should be examined carefully. Please contact Dr. Graham for any clarifications.</p>

<h2 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h2>
<p>The University Senate defines plagiarism as “presenting, whether intentionally or not, the ideas, expression of ideas or work of others as one’s own.” This can include: 
- reproducing or paraphrasing portions of someone else’s published or unpublished material, regardless of the source, and presenting these as one’s own without proper citation or reference to the original source;
- submitting a take home examination, essay, laboratory report or other assignment written, in whole or in part, by someone else; 
- using ideas or direct, verbatim quotations, or paraphrased material, concepts, or ideas without appropriate acknowledgment in any academic assignment; 
- using another’s data or research findings; 
- failing to acknowledge sources through the use of proper citations when using another’s works and/or failing to use quotation marks; 
- handing in "substantially the same piece of work for academic credit more than once without prior written permission of the course instructor in which the submission occurs." </p>
<p>Plagiarism is a serious offence which cannot be resolved directly with the course’s instructor. The Associate Dean of the Faculty conducts a rigorous investigation, including an interview with the student, when an instructor suspects a piece of work has been plagiarized. Penalties are not trivial. They can include a final grade of "F" for the course.</p>

<p>The last date to withdraw from Fall/Winter and Winter term courses is April 8, 2016. </p>
<h2 id="requests-for-academic-accommodation">Requests for academic accommodation</h2>
<p>You may need special arrangements to meet your academic obligations during the term because of disability, pregnancy or religious obligations. Please review the course outline promptly and write to the instructor with any requests for academic accommodation during the first two weeks of class, or as soon as possible after the need for accommodation is known to exist.</p>
<p>Students with disabilities requiring academic accommodations in this course must register with the Paul Menton Centre for Students with Disabilities (PMC) for a formal evaluation of disability-related needs. Documented disabilities could include but are not limited to mobility/physical impairments, specific Learning Disabilities (LD), psychiatric/psychological disabilities, sensory disabilities, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and chronic medical conditions. Registered PMC students are required to contact the PMC, 613-520-6608, every term to ensure that your Instructor receives your Letter of Accommodation, no later than two weeks before the first assignment is due or the first in-class test/midterm requiring accommodations. If you only require accommodations for your formally scheduled exam(s) in this course, please submit your request for accommodations to PMC by March 6, 2016 for the winter term. You can visit the Equity Services website to view the policies and to obtain more detailed information on academic accommodation at http://carleton.ca/equity/accommodation</p>

<p>Increasingly, numerous historical documents making massive amounts of data are being put online. But, once that material is online, we face a question of ‘so what?’ This course will give you the digital research and data management skills and reflexive theoretical grounding to answer the ‘so what’. As digital historian Adam Crymble writes, ‘We’ve spent millions digitizing the world’s historical resources. Let’s work together to figure out what they can teach us’.</p>
<p>This course is about crafting digital history, about data mining documents, about reading distantly thousands of documents at once, about graphing/mapping/visualizing what we find, and working out how to best communicate those findings. It is about writing history in digital media, which are primarily visual media. Thus, we will learn how to scrape data, how to find meaningful patterns within it, and how to visualize (via websites or infographics) those results. Readings will be from relevant literature in the field (mostly open access).</p>
<p>Things will go wrong. Stuff will break. You will be frustrated. This will not be easy, but it will be rewarding if you stick it out.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify and define the limitations of useful sources of historical data online</li>
<li>Compare and employ appropriate tools to clean and manipulate this data with a critical eye to how the tools themselves are theory-laden</li>
<li>Analyze data using various tools with an awareness of the tendency of tools to push towards various historiographic or epistemic perspectives (ie, the ‘procedural rhetorics’ of various tools)</li>
<li>Visualize meaningful patterns in the data to write ‘good history’ across multiple platforms, with critical evaluation of the limitations</li>
<li>Model best practices in open access data management as mandated by SSHRC and other research agencies</li>
<li>Develop an online scholarly voice to contribute data and reflection to the wider digital history community</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h2>
<p>The modules in the course are built around the progressive steps of working with big data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Principles of open access research and your digital identity (learning outcomes 5,6)</li>
<li>Finding Data (learning outcomes 1)</li>
<li>‘Wrangling’ Data, or getting it into useable shape (learning outcome 2)</li>
<li>First Questions, or where are the holes and assumptions in your data?</li>
<li>Analyzing data, or matching the appropriate tool to the question (learning outcomes 1,2,3)</li>
<li>Visualizing (graphing, writing, plotting, mapping) data patterns, or communicating the compelling story (learning outcome 4)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="textbook">Textbook</h2>
<p>The course workbook is free, and may be found at workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca  </p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-need-to-succeed">What do you need to succeed?</h2>
<p>This course is not easy. It has no mutliple choice tests, no assignments that you can crib via a google search. Rather, it expects you to take responsibility for your own learning, and for you to make a convincing argument showing how you’ve changed as a historian. It requires you to be</p>
<ul>
<li>self-directed;</li>
<li>motivated;</li>
<li>self-disciplined;</li>
<li>able to admit to yourself and to others when things aren’t going according to plan;</li>
<li>able to collaborate with others in a transparent manner, giving credit where credit is due;</li>
<li>committed to working through in public the problems and potentials of digital history;</li>
</ul>
<p>If this sounds like you, or someone you are willing to become, then you will be ok. Now that you’ve got this far, please make sure to complete the ‘<a href="questionnaire.html">pre class questionnaire</a>’.</p>

<p>In our Slack channel, you can always send me a direct message. That is probably the most efficient (and preferred) way for you to contact me. Within Slack, we can set up instant video chats - simply type /appear roomname where roomname can be whatever you want (it acts like a location for our conversation), when we are both online. Othertimes, I might put together large-scale real-time video conferencing; for that I will use tools in cuLearn and I will advise you of the same. </p>
