<h1 id="due-dates">Due Dates</h1>
<p>Because this is an online course, and it is entirely feasible that one might complete all of the work in short order, the due dates for work are necessarily extended.</p>
<h2 id="final-project-and-associated-paradata">Final Project and associated paradata</h2>
<p>Submit the link to your final project by the final day of term, via a direct message to me in Slack.
    + I would also like a one-page summary of work to date, topic, any agreed upon collaboration (which would include a paragraph on roles, responsibilities, and plan for resolving disputes), scale and scope to be sent to me via direct message in Slack by the end of the first week of March.</p>
<h2 id="exhibit-of-your-learning">Exhibit of your learning</h2>
<p>That is, your selected module exercises. Submit the link to your exhibit detailing your growth in this classs, at any point up to the final day of term. While I have specified a minimum for what needs to go in here, you are free to include other items (such as blog posts, videos) etc that help tell the story. </p>
<p>The <a href="assessment.html">Assessment</a> and <a href="finalproject.html">Final Project</a> pages should be examined carefully. Please contact Dr. Graham for any clarifications.</p>
<p>Below, please find the standard academic regulations boilerplate.</p>

<h2 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h2>
<p>The University Senate defines plagiarism as “presenting, whether intentionally or not, the ideas, expression of ideas or work of others as one’s own.” This can include: 
- reproducing or paraphrasing portions of someone else’s published or unpublished material, regardless of the source, and presenting these as one’s own without proper citation or reference to the original source;
- submitting a take home examination, essay, laboratory report or other assignment written, in whole or in part, by someone else; 
- using ideas or direct, verbatim quotations, or paraphrased material, concepts, or ideas without appropriate acknowledgment in any academic assignment; 
- using another’s data or research findings; 
- failing to acknowledge sources through the use of proper citations when using another’s works and/or failing to use quotation marks; 
- handing in "substantially the same piece of work for academic credit more than once without prior written permission of the course instructor in which the submission occurs." </p>
<p>Plagiarism is a serious offence which cannot be resolved directly with the course’s instructor. The Associate Dean of the Faculty conducts a rigorous investigation, including an interview with the student, when an instructor suspects a piece of work has been plagiarized. Penalties are not trivial. They can include a final grade of "F" for the course.</p>

<p>The Carleton University Human Rights Policies and Procedures affirm that all members of the University community share a responsibility to: 
- promote equity and fairness, 
- respect and value diversity, 
- prevent discrimination and harassment, and 
- preserve the freedom of its members to carry out responsibly their scholarly work without threat of interference. </p>
<p>Carleton University Equity Services states that “every member of the University community has a right to study, work and live in a safe environment free of discrimination or harassment”. </p>
<p><em><a href="codeofconduct.html">please see my own code of conduct for this class</a></em></p>
<p>Standing in a course is determined by the course instructor subject to the approval of the Faculty Dean. This means that grades submitted by the instructor may be subject to revision. No grades are final until they have been approved by the Dean.</p>
<h2 id="withdrawal-without-academic-penalty">Withdrawal without academic penalty</h2>
<p>The last date to withdraw from Fall/Winter and Winter term courses is April 8, 2016. </p>
<h2 id="requests-for-academic-accommodation">Requests for academic accommodation</h2>
<p>You may need special arrangements to meet your academic obligations during the term because of disability, pregnancy or religious obligations. Please review the course outline promptly and write to the instructor with any requests for academic accommodation during the first two weeks of class, or as soon as possible after the need for accommodation is known to exist.</p>
<p>Students with disabilities requiring academic accommodations in this course must register with the Paul Menton Centre for Students with Disabilities (PMC) for a formal evaluation of disability-related needs. Documented disabilities could include but are not limited to mobility/physical impairments, specific Learning Disabilities (LD), psychiatric/psychological disabilities, sensory disabilities, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and chronic medical conditions. Registered PMC students are required to contact the PMC, 613-520-6608, every term to ensure that your Instructor receives your Letter of Accommodation, no later than two weeks before the first assignment is due or the first in-class test/midterm requiring accommodations. If you only require accommodations for your formally scheduled exam(s) in this course, please submit your request for accommodations to PMC by March 6, 2016 for the winter term. You can visit the Equity Services website to view the policies and to obtain more detailed information on academic accommodation at http://carleton.ca/equity/accommodation</p>
