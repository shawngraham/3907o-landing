<h1 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h1>
<p>Your final project is to craft an original work of digital history. That is:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will demonstrate via your project, mastery of the five modules in this course
<em>ie, you conceive, create, document, a work of digital history that</em> visualizes <em>some argument about the past from a dataset you have either found or created yourself.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The actual <em>form</em> of the project is up to you: but the key element is that the form you select should follow the function. Some kinds of analyses are better suited to the visual stylings of an infographic; others would be best explicated using a kind of long-form mixture of text and visuals; still others might be best represented via an interactive map or a hand-held locative app.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F5sZyTcvhH4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h2 id="datacapta"><strong>Data/Capta</strong></h2>
<p>Johanna Drucker exhorts us to remember that 'data' are actually 'capta', that is, they are not 'things given', but rather 'things captured', as it were. (I will use the two terms interchangeably, depending on my mood). In which case, you are welcome to work on whatever historical information you can put together yourself, or find <strong>if and only if you clear it with me within the first three weeks of class. </strong></p>
<p>If you'd rather work with an existing database (and I <strong>strongly</strong> encourage you to do this), I will suggest you explore these excellent datasets -</p>
<ul>
<li>the '<a href="https://github.com/mhbeals/scissorsandpaste/blob/master/Outputs/CSV/TEISAP.csv">Colonial Newspapers Database</a>', by Dr. Melodee Beals, and</li>
<li>the '<a href="http://sharonhoward.github.io/cdt/">Middlesex Convicts Database</a>' compiled by Dr. Sharon Howard (from a much larger database).</li>
<li>a selection <a href="https://www.lib.msu.edu/dh/humdata/">in MSU Libraries</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="analysis"><strong>Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>You will learn of a number of tools, techniques and approaches to working with capta over the duration of this class. Your project should use at least one of these analytic or exploratory tools in a manner that is suitable given the source data. You will have to think about what the choice of tool does to the kind of story you can tell. Your analysis <strong>must be grounded in the appropriate secondary literature for the period/issue. </strong>It is <strong>critical </strong>that you use your open notebook and your research narrative to document what you are doing and why. This will enable you to write the accompanying <strong>paradata</strong> document.</p>
<p>You will<strong>share</strong> your final project and all <em>ancillary files</em> by keeping them in a repository in your github space; the final project will be mounted in your own domain. <strong>You will submit your final work to me by sending me the URL via a direct message in our Slack channel.</strong></p>
<h2 id="visualization"><strong>Visualization</strong></h2>
<p>See the tools and techniques in the final two modules of the workbook for inspiration; make sure your visual styling supports the key themes and ideas your research is exploring.</p>
<h2 id="length"><strong>Length</strong></h2>
<p>In this context, to speak of 'length' makes no sense. Page numbers and word counts do not scholarship make. In years past, students have submitted everything from long form graphically enhanced essays, to interactive maps, to videos, to posters. To know if you're 'done', ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have I stated my key questions/provocations well?</li>
<li>Are my arguments grounded in appropriate secondary literature?</li>
<li>Have I described my methods well enough that someone else could reproduce them?</li>
<li>Have I explored the nature of my data/capta and thought through the implications?</li>
<li>Does my argument hang together?</li>
<li>Do my visuals support/enhance my argument/story?</li>
<li>Do I have all my sources (including data &amp; code) cited? Use Harvard author:date style.</li>
<li>Have I documented the paradata? </li>
</ul>
<p>If the answer is 'yes' to all of the above, then you are done.</p>
<h2 id="shortcuts"><strong>Shortcuts</strong></h2>
<p>Many digital projects make their code available on Github. You don't have to reinvent the wheel: you merely have to cite it! So google around 'digital history project', and see what people are doing. Keep an eye out for 'how did they do that', a tag that will lead you to videos, walkthroughs, and other useful items. Indeed, the 'how did they do that' is starting to become a recognized academic genre of writing, see for instance the <a href="http://dhcommons.org/journal/issue-1/how-did-they-make-adams-timeline">DHCommons Journal</a></p>
<h1 id="project-management"><strong>Project Management</strong></h1>
<p>There are many resources out there to help you manage your project; I suggest you start with <a href="http://devdh.org">DevDH</a> and in particular, Appleford, Simon, and Jennifer Guiliano. 'Best Practice Principles Of Designing Your First Project.' DevDH.org, 2013. <a href="http://devdh.org/lectures/design/bestpractice/">http://devdh.org/lectures/design/bestpractice/</a></p>
<p>Per DevDH, the components of a project are the:</p>
<p>1. the question, problem, or provocation</p>
<p>2. sources (primary, secondary)</p>
<p>3. analytical activity</p>
<p>4. audience</p>
<p>5. product</p>
<p>Note that 4, audience, comes before 5, product. You <strong>must </strong>think of your reader! Yes, in the first instance, I am the most important reader of your work as I am the one in charge of the gradebook. But that is actually a secondary consideration. Given your data, given your analytic approach, who would most likely be interested in your material? If you were trying to produce an infographic about the debates surrounding the BNA of 1867 for high school classroom use, your use of language, graphics, and colour etc could be very different than if you were just trying to convince <strong>me.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Remember: your project work is public.* Design &amp; write accordingly.</strong></p>
<p>*unless you have privacy concerns. In which case, you simply have to tell me that you have concerns. I do not need to know what they are. If you wish for your work to be private, we will make it so.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Devising a Workplan</span></p>
<p>It is helpful to start sketching out a workplan now. I would like if you would post this on your blog or open notebook.  <em>This is not a grading requirement</em>. It is, rather, good practice. Public workplans are more likely to get done...</p>
<p>See Appleford, Simon, and Jennifer Guiliano. 'Building Your First Work Plan.' DevDH.org, 2013. <a href="http://devdh.org/lectures/manageproject/workplan/">http://devdh.org/lectures/manageproject/workplan/</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Planning your time</span></p>
<p>1. How many hours, total, do you think you have this term outside of class time, work time, social time? Divide that by 12 (ie, your courses run for 12 weeks). That's how many hours per week you can spend <em>on all your non in-class course work.</em></p>
<p>2. Divide those hours by the number of courses you have. </p>
<p>That's how much time you have to spend on <strong>everything</strong> I'm asking you to do - including readings, videos, video chats with me, pratice, tech snafus. Call it X.</p>
<p>3. Look at the <a href="http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca">modules for this course</a>. Which parts do you think will be hardest for you? How much time do you think you'll need for each one? I reckon for me that it'd take about 3 hours per module <em>to do just the exercises</em>, if everything goes well each time. That doesn't include writing up the notebooks &amp; narrative, which should take another hour or so per module.</p>
<p>Total that up. Call this Y.</p>
<p><strong>You've got</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>X - Y = time left over for the final project</strong></p>
<p>Not a lot, eh?  (The modules correspond to the various steps in working with data. Build into your plan time to learn the tool you think you're most likely going to use.)</p>
<h1 id="but-what-if-it-doesnt-work"><strong>But what if it doesn't work?</strong></h1>
<p>My first major digital history project was called 'HeritageCrowd'. It was a crowdsourcing site for oral history. I neglected a very crucial step in the online security of dynamic websites. As a result, I lost the</p>
<p>whole.</p>
<p>darned.</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>Sometimes, despite our best efforts, a project just doesn't come together. Or we get to the end of it, and realize that we would've been better off to spend more time on A rather than B. Or maybe we feel that, after a whole lot of work, our conclusions just seem a bit ...flat, considering the effort.</p>
<p>Sometimes, things just don't work. <strong>THAT IS OK HERE. </strong>Seriously. I mean it. It is <strong>safe </strong>here to take chances, to push things beyond the envelope - if you can document what you were doing and reflect on <strong>why</strong> it didn't work. Here's <a href="http://electricarchaeology.ca/2012/05/18/how-i-lost-the-crowd-a-tale-of-sorrow-and-hope/">the piece I wrote when I realized that my project was dead.</a> It's ok to have something not work out if we can extract meaning from the debris. This is why your <strong>paradata</strong> document is so important, and why it is a separate assessment piece.</p>
<p>If you think your project has somehow come up short, make sure you document and reflect on why this has hapened. Send me a DM in our slack space invoking your 'Productive Fail' card. This will alert me to be aware of this when I look at your project. Then make sure your <strong>paradata </strong>document contains an extremely detailed analysis of what went wrong and why: title this section 'Productive Fail'. This will have the effect of transferring points for your project to your paradata.</p>
<h1 id="grading"><strong>Grading</strong></h1>
<p>The criteria are those of the '<a href="http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Teaching/the-unessay">unessay</a>', as developed by <a href="http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/">Daniel Paul O'Donell</a>. That is, the work is graded according to the degree to which it is compelling and the degree to which it is effective:</p>
<p>"[the project] is <em>compelling</em> when it shows some combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is as interesting as its topic and approach allows</li>
<li>it is as complete as its topic and approach allows (it doesn’t leave the audience thinking that important points are being skipped over or ignored)</li>
<li>it is truthful (any questions, evidence, conclusions, or arguments you raise are honestly and accurately presented)</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of presentation, [the project] is <em>effective</em> when it shows some combination of these attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is readable/watchable/listenable (i.e. the production values are appropriately high and the audience is not distracted by avoidable lapses in presentation)</li>
<li>it is appropriate (i.e. it uses a format and medium that suits its topic and approach)</li>
<li>it is attractive (i.e. it is presented in a way that leads the audience to trust the author and his or her arguments, examples, and conclusions)." </li>
</ul>
